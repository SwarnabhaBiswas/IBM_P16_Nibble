## 🟥 Problem Statement

Cooking at home can be frustrating due to:

- Complex and unclear recipe steps  
- Missing ingredients and lack of substitutes  
- No built-in timers or contextual help  
- Juggling between devices/screens while cooking  

🎯 **Goal**: Build an interactive AI cooking agent that:
- Offers real-time guidance
- Suggests substitutions
- Sets cooking timers
- Answers contextual questions (e.g., “Show me step 3 again”)

🛠️ **Constraint**: Must use IBM Cloud Lite (Watson/Granite) with Agentic AI logic.

## 🟨 Proposed Solution

Introducing **Nibble** – a friendly, intelligent cooking agent that:

- Suggests recipes based on what users have
- Offers ingredient substitutions when needed
- Guides users through interactive, step-by-step instructions
- Sets and manages cooking timers
- Responds to questions like:
  - “What can I use instead of sour cream?”
  - “Show me step 2 again.”

## 🟩 System Development Approach

**Technology Stack:**
- IBM Watson Assistant or Granite for NLP & logic

**Data Sources:**
- Recipe APIs
- Ingredient substitution datasets
- User interaction history

---

## 🟧 Agentic AI Logic & Deployment

Nibble’s logic is modular and conversation-driven:

### 🧩 Agent Workflow:

1. **Recipe Initialization** – “What would you like to cook?”
2. **Ingredient Validation** – Confirms user inventory
3. **Stepwise Guidance** – Gives clear cooking instructions

---

## 🟦 Results

Nibble supports natural interaction such as:

- “Start Chicken Curry recipe.”  
- “I don’t have garam masala — what else can I use?”  
- “Set a 15-minute timer.”  
- “Repeat the last step.”  
- “Should my pasta be al dente now?”  

✅ Context-aware responses  
✅ Reduces stress & multitasking errors  
✅ Enhances kitchen confidence
